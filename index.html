   This article presents the important invention of self-healing concrete and its environmental benefits over conventional methods. 
   It also outlines why despite its usage aligning with the “UK reaching its net zero goals by 2050” <a href="#(UK Gov, 2022)">(UK Gov, 2022)</a>, self-healing 
   concrete isn’t a widely used material and “conventional methods are still the most popular”, <a href="#(Chahar, 2022)">(Chahar, 2022)</a>.

   “Self-healing concrete is mostly defined as the ability of concrete to repair its cracks autogenously or autonomously. It is also
   called self-repairing concrete.” <a href="#(Han, 2014)">(Han, 2014)</a>. Having only been “invented in 2006 by the microbiologist professor Henk Jonkers, at 
   Delft University of Technology, Netherlands” <a href="(Jonkers, 2007)">(Jonkers, 2007)</a> it is a relatively new alternative method to conventional concrete. 
   This is very apt in timing since conventional “concrete is the single most widely used material in the world and has a carbon footprint
   to match.” <a href="(Royal Society of Chemistry, 2008)">(Royal Society of Chemistry, 2008)</a>. Therefore one of the ideas behind the invention of self-healing concrete (SHC) is the 
   potential reduction in carbon emissions, which is a crisis in the construction industry. In fact “concrete is worse for the climate 
   than flying” <a href="(Tigue, 2022)">(Tigue, 2022)</a>. SHC will achieve this since instead of having to replace concrete over time, with little monitoring, SHC 
   will repair itself. 
     
   Therefore over a long period of time the carbon emissions of concrete production will fall. SHC unlike other conventional concretes is 
   unique. The process of repairing is achieved in one of two ways: “autogenously or autonomously” <a href="#(Han, 2014)">(Han, 2014)</a>. “Autogenous healing relies 
   solely on material intrinsic to the cementitious matrix to heal itself. For autonomous healing, foreign elements such as polymers or 
   bacteria are introduced into the concrete to achieve healing. The healing material is typically stored in a vessel embedded in the matrix. 
   Once released from the capsules, the healing agents adhere to the crack faces with the aim to seal openings, recover mechanical properties
   and prevent further crack propagation.” <a href="(Guo, 2019)">(Guo, 2019)</a>. “The capsule-based self-healing, the vascular self-healing, and the microbiological 
   self-healing are the most common types of self-healing techniques” <a href="#(Han, 2014)">(Han, 2014)</a> all of which are autonomous.

<h3 id="What are the Environmental Benefits and Costs over Conventional Methods?">What are the Environmental Benefits and Costs over Conventional Methods?</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre>
      
   Conventional concrete methods in the construction industry primarily refer to concrete composed of a “combination of a number different and 
   distinct parts or items that are grouped together such as: cement, sand, stone, and water” <a href="(Quora, 2021)">(Quora, 2021)</a>. This can be strengthened with the 
   addition of rebar which produces reinforced concrete, “which is one of the world’s most common building materials”, <a href="#(Chahar, 2022)">(Chahar, 2022)</a>.
     
   There are three main benefits to SHC over conventional methods:

   <u1>
   <li>“Reducing Shrinkage Reinforcement - By providing concrete with self-healing properties, larger crack widths can be accepted in the design 
   phase, which means that the shrinkage reinforcement can be significantly reduced. Reduction of up to 40% is possible.” <a href="(Basilisk, 2021)">(Basilisk, 2021)</a>.</li>
   <li>“Less Downtime leading to a Longer Lifespan - The amount of unexpected repairs are significantly reduced, which would normally lead to 
   traffic jams or downtime. In addition, Self-Healing Concrete extends its lifespan by approximately 30 to 40%.” <a href="(Basilisk, 2021)">(Basilisk, 2021)</a>. Therefore 
   reducing the maintenance costs over an extended period of time.</li>
   <li>“Reduction of CO2 emissions - By adding crack healing micro-organisms to the concrete mix, steel can be reduced significantly. This way 
   SHC delivers an important contribution to a lower environmental impact. The environmental indicators such as CO2 emissions, are an important 
   driver for achieving the international agreed environmental objectives.” <a href="(Basilisk, 2021)">(Basilisk, 2021)</a>.</li>
   </u1>

   Out of these three benefits, the third has the most significant benefit over conventional methods since it aligns far more with the governments
   “strategy of policies and proposals for decarbonising all sectors of the UK economy to meet our net zero goals by 2050” <a href="#(UK Gov, 2022)">(UK Gov, 2022)</a>.

   Despite its environmental benefits which could allow the “UK to reach its net zero goals by 2050” <a href="#(UK Gov, 2022)">(UK Gov, 2022)</a>, SHC is hardly being used at 
   all in the construction industry and “conventional methods are still the most popular”, <a href="#(Chahar, 2022)">(Chahar, 2022)</a>. The simple truth is that “SHC is 
   considered an experimental material” <a href="(Nguyen, 2023)">(Nguyen, 2023)</a> despite its “invention in 2006” <a href="(Jonkers, 2007)">(Jonkers, 2007)</a> 17 years ago. Therefore, it is not a 
   mainstream material which leads further to other issues. 
    
   Cost. “Normally the price of concrete is around $150 per cubic meter, but using bacteria-infused self-healing concrete, that price can 
   increase to $6,000 per cubic meter.” <a href="(Shah, 2022)">(Shah,2022)</a>. Part of this cost is also due to “the higher-level expertise and technical knowledge
   required to mix the concrete appropriately” <a href="(Shah, 2022)">(Shah,2022)</a>, which can lead further to ‘complications that might slow the construction process” 
   <a href="(Shah, 2022)">(Shah,2022)</a>. Another significant drawback is the impact to structural integrity. “SHC is developed by incorporating specific elements (such as
   fibres or capsules) into a concrete mix that contains repairing solutions. When a crack appears, the fibres or capsules break, and the liquid 
   contained within them spreads and heals the crack at the same moment.” <a href="(Amran, 2022)">(Amran, 2022)</a>. These “fibres or capsules” <a id="(Amran, 2022)">1.</a> are the same 
   materials being added “to the concrete resulting in weakening the concrete’s original compressive strength” <a href="(Shah, 2022)">(Shah,2022)</a>, 2leading to the 
   weakening of the structural integrity.

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
      
   The addition of self-healing concrete in the construction industry has given a new avenue of approach in order to decrease the carbon 
   emissions of concrete. As well, the “increased lifespan by approximately 30% to 40%” <a href="(Basilisk, 2021)">(Basilisk, 2021)</a> will have a long-term net benefit to 
   both lower costs and the UK Governments “net zero goal by 2050” <a href="#(UK Gov, 2022)">(UK Gov, 2022)</a>. However, the cons of SHC being “40x the price of 
   conventional methods” <a href="(Shah, 2022)">(Shah,2022)</a> and there being “impacts to the structural integrity does” <a href="(Amran, 2022)">(Amran, 2022)</a> does still lead to SHC being 
   classed as an experimental material. Therefore, “before introducing this concept commercially a large scale demonstration is required” 
   <a href="(Vijay, 2017)">(Vijay, 2017)</a> as well as further research to ensure that it can be safely used across the globe.
