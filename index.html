    ‘Self-healing concrete is mostly defined as the ability of concrete to repair its cracks autogenously or autonomously. It is also called self-repairing concrete.’ (Han (2014)). Having only been ‘invented in 2006 by the microbiologist professor Henk 
    Jonkers, at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands’ (Jonkers (2007)) it is a relatively new alternative method to conventional concrete. This is very apt in timing since conventional ‘Concrete is the single most widely used material in the 
    world and has a carbon footprint to match.’ (Royal Society of Chemistry (2008)). 
     
    Therefore one of the ideas behind the invention of SHC is the potential reduction carbon emissions which is a crisis in the construction industry, in fact ‘concrete is worse for the climate than flying’ (Tigue (2022). SHC will achieve this since instead
    of having to replace concrete over time, with little monitoring, SHC will repair itself. Therefore over a long period of time the carbon emissions of concrete production will fall. 
    
    SHC unlike other conventional concretes is unique in the fact in can repair itself. This process is achieved in one of two ways: ‘autogenously or autonomously’ (Han (2014)). ‘Autogenous healing relies solely on material intrinsic to the cementitious 
    matrix to heal itself. For autonomous healing, foreign elements such as polymers or bacteria are introduced into the concrete to achieve healing. The healing material is typically stored in a vessel embedded in the matrix. Once released from the 
    capsules, the healing agents adhere to the crack faces with the aim to seal openings, recover mechanical properties and prevent further crack propagation.’ (Guo (2019)). ‘The capsule-based self-healing, the vascular self-healing, and the microbiological 
    self-healing are the most common types of self-healing techniques’ (Han (2014)) all of which are autonomous.
