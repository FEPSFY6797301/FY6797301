    This article presents the important invention of self-healing concrete and its environmental benefits over conventional methods. It also outlines why despite its usage aligning with the “UK reaching its net
    zero goals by 2050” (UK Gov, 2022), self-healing concrete isn’t a widely used material and “conventional methods are still the most popular”, (Chahar, 2022).

   “Self-healing concrete is mostly defined as the ability of concrete to repair its cracks autogenously or autonomously. It is also called self-repairing concrete.” (Han, 2014). Having only been “invented 
   in 2006 by the microbiologist professor Henk Jonkers, at Delft University of Technology, Netherlands” (Jonkers, 2007) it is a relatively new alternative method to conventional concrete. This is very apt
   in timing since conventional “concrete is the single most widely used material in the world and has a carbon footprint to match.” (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2008). Therefore one of the ideas behind the
   invention of self-healing concrete (SHC) is the potential reduction in carbon emissions, which is a crisis in the construction industry. In fact “concrete is worse for the climate than flying” (Tigue, 2022).
   SHC will achieve this since instead of having to replace concrete over time, with little monitoring, SHC will repair itself. 
     
   Therefore over a long period of time the carbon emissions of concrete production will fall. SHC unlike other conventional concretes is unique. The process of repairing is achieved in one of two ways: 
   “autogenously or autonomously” (Han, 2014). “Autogenous healing relies solely on material intrinsic to the cementitious matrix to heal itself. For autonomous healing, foreign elements such as polymers or 
   bacteria are introduced into the concrete to achieve healing. The healing material is typically stored in a vessel embedded in the matrix. Once released from the capsules, the healing agents adhere to the 
   crack faces with the aim to seal openings, recover mechanical properties and prevent further crack propagation.” (Guo, 2019). “The capsule-based self-healing, the vascular self-healing, and the 
   microbiological self-healing are the most common types of self-healing techniques” (Han, 2014) all of which are autonomous.

     Conventional concrete methods in the construction industry primarily refer to concrete composed of a “combination of a number different and distinct parts or items that are grouped together such as: cement, sand, stone, and water” (Quora, 2021). This can be strengthened with the addition of rebar which produces reinforced concrete, “which is one of the world’s most common building materials”. (Chahar, 2022).
     There are three main benefits to SHC over conventional methods:
     1.	“Reducing Shrinkage Reinforcement - By providing concrete with self-healing properties, larger crack widths can be accepted in the design phase, which means that the shrinkage reinforcement can be significantly reduced. Reduction of up to 40% is possible.” (Basilisk, 2021).
     2.	“Less Downtime leading to a Longer Lifespan - The amount of unexpected repairs are significantly reduced, which would normally lead to traffic jams or downtime. In addition, Self-Healing Concrete extends its lifespan by approximately 30 to 40%.” (Basilisk, 2021). Therefore reducing the maintenance costs over an extended period of time.
     3.	“Reduction of CO2 emissions - By adding crack healing micro-organisms to the concrete mix, steel can be reduced significantly. This way SHC delivers an important contribution to a lower environmental impact. The environmental indicators such as CO2 emissions, are an important driver for achieving the international agreed environmental objectives.” (Basilisk, 2021).

    Despite its environmental benefits which could allow the “UK to reach its net zero goals by 2050” (UK Gov, 2022), SHC is hardly being used at all in the construction industry and “conventional methods are still the most popular”, (Chahar, 2022). 
    The simple truth is that “SHC is considered an experimental material” (Nguyen, 2023) despite its “invention in 2006” (Jonkers, 2006) 17 years ago. Therefore, it is not a mainstream material which leads further to other issues. 
    Cost. “Normally the price of concrete is around $150 per cubic meter, but using bacteria-infused self-healing concrete, that price can increase to $6,000 per cubic meter.” (Shah, 2022). Part of this cost is also due to “the higher-level expertise and technical knowledge required to mix the concrete appropriately” (Shah, 2022), which can lead further to ‘complications that might slow the construction process” (Shah, 2022). 
    Another significant drawback is the impact to structural integrity. “SHC is developed by incorporating specific elements (such as fibres or capsules) into a concrete mix that contains repairing solutions. When a crack appears, the fibres or capsules break, and the liquid contained within them spreads and heals the crack at the same moment.” (Amran, 2022). These “fibres or capsules” (Amran, 2022) are the same materials being added “to the concrete resulting in weakening the concrete’s original compressive strength” (Shah, 2022), leading to the weakening of the structural integrity.
